# üöÄ OpenAdapter

**Effortless Deployment and Integration for Advanced UI Action Models**

OpenAdapter is a deployment tool designed for model builders and users who need efficient, high-performance deployment of state-of-the-art screenshot parsing models. With OpenAdapter, you can quickly and easily set up these models on trusted hardware that you control, enabling automation with action and screenshot data on local or securely managed systems.

This repository supports multiple cloud backends‚Äîinitially with AWS, Hugging Face Inference API, and compatibility with frontier model APIs (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI)‚Äîmaking it ideal for flexible, scalable deployment in diverse automation use cases and [OpenAdapt](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/OpenAdapt)-agnostic implementations.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Automated Cloud Deployment**: Rapidly deploy models on AWS EC2, Hugging Face Inference API, or connect with Anthropic/OpenAI APIs for remote inference.
- **Configurable via `.env`**: Simplify setup with a customizable environment file.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Deploy high-performance instances on demand; easily pause or stop resources to minimize costs.
- **Compatibility with Dockerized Models or Frontier Model APIs**: OpenAdapter supports models like OmniParser and Set-of-Mark (SoM) as examples. It's designed to plug into any project with a Dockerfile and can even autogenerate one if necessary. It also enables seamless integration with non-containerized APIs like Anthropic's and OpenAI's.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **[AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)** with necessary permissions for deploying on EC2  
   _(Support for [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), Anthropic, and OpenAI APIs is planned but not yet available)_
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` with repository access

### Installation
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/OpenAdapter.git
   cd OpenAdapter
   ```
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with your cloud and GitHub credentials:
   ```plaintext
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your aws access key id>
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your aws secret access key>
   AWS_REGION=<your aws region>
   GITHUB_OWNER=<your github owner>        # e.g., OpenAdaptAI
   GITHUB_REPO=<your github repo>          # e.g., OmniParser
   GITHUB_TOKEN=<your github token>
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r deploy_requirements.txt
   ```

## üí° Usage Examples
This tool provides straightforward commands for deploying and managing model instances.

### Start the Deployment
To deploy a model (such as OmniParser or Set-of-Mark) on an AWS EC2 instance with GPU and 100GB storage (default), run:
```bash
python deploy.py start
```

### Interact with the Deployed Model
After deployment, you can interact with the model server:
```bash
python client.py "http://<server_ip>:7861"
```

### Pause or Stop the Instance
Pause the instance (shutdown without deleting resources):
```bash
python deploy.py pause
```

Stop the instance entirely, freeing all associated resources:
```bash
python deploy.py stop
```

### Check Server Status
To check the status of the EC2 instance and retrieve its public IP:
```bash
python deploy.py status
```

### SSH Access
SSH into the deployed instance for direct access:
```bash
python deploy.py ssh
```

## üí≤ Costs
- **Approximate Cost**: Running a model on the default `AWS g4dn.xlarge` instance with 100GB storage costs around $10/day ($0.526/hr) in most AWS regions.  
   _(Configuration uses `g4dn.xlarge` with T4 16GB GPU and Deep Learning AMI GPU PyTorch 2.0.1 on Ubuntu 20.04, as defined in `deploy.config.AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_TYPE`)_.

## Modular Cloud Backends
OpenAdapter is designed with a modular backend structure to support multiple cloud providers and frontier model APIs. Current backends include:
- **AWS**: For deploying on EC2, with options for instance types, storage, and security settings.
- **Hugging Face Inference API**: For deploying models directly on Hugging Face‚Äôs infrastructure, suitable for lighter workloads and models.
- **Anthropic/OpenAI APIs**: Seamless integration with remote model inference on Anthropic and OpenAI‚Äôs systems, extending capabilities to hosted large language models.

---

## Integrations
OpenAdapter is intended for OpenAdapt-agnostic deployments but also serves as a complementary tool for OpenAdaptAI's [OpenAdapt](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/OpenAdapt) project. It can be customized to suit various automation, data processing, or model inference applications beyond OpenAdapt, providing a standalone, scalable solution for deploying state-of-the-art models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap
- **Automation with AWS CDK**: Integrate AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for Infrastructure as Code, simplifying deployment workflows and enabling reproducible environments with minimal setup.
- **Containerized Deployments with ECS and ECR**: Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for scalable model deployment and automated container management.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Expand backend support to include Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure for more deployment options.
- **GPU Resource Optimization**: Incorporate GPU utilization monitoring and auto-scaling based on load to optimize cost and performance.
- **Serverless Inference Options**: Add support for serverless deployments using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
- **Enhanced API Integrations**: Extend integration with additional model APIs, including Cohere and Aleph Alpha, for a wider range of model options.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Implement data encryption at rest and in transit, with options for integrating with virtual private cloud (VPC) configurations.
- **Automated Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate with AWS CloudWatch and other monitoring tools for comprehensive real-time logging, alerting, and automated incident response.
- **Nix Support for Reproducibility**: Enable consistent builds and simplified dependency management for improved cross-platform deployment and rollback capabilities.
